            <p>What's up, code warriors and pixel pushers! 👋 Ready for a wild ride through the evolution of web frameworks? 
            Grab your favourite caffeinated beverage ☕️, because we're about to blast from the past to the future faster than you can say "npm install react"! 
            Let's dive into the thrilling, frustrating, and sometimes downright bizarre world of web development. 🏄‍♂️💻</p>
            
            <p>From the dark ages of table-based layouts to the shining future of AI-assisted coding, we've come a long way. 
            This journey has been filled with triumphs, tears, and more deprecated APIs than we care to remember. 
            So, strap in, fellow developers, as we embark on this nostalgic yet forward-looking adventure!</p>

            <p>Picture this: it's the early 2000s. Britney Spears is topping the charts, flip phones are the height of tech, 
            and developers are battling with vanilla JavaScript like it's a ferocious T-Rex. 🦖</p>

            that new browser called "Chrome"? Cross-browser compatibility was the stuff of nightmares, and CSS hacks were our teddy bears.</p>

            <h2 class="animated-header">🍔 jQuery: The Challenges of Ye Olde Vanilla JS</h2>
            <p>Then, in 2006, jQuery rolled up like a food truck in a desert of despair. Suddenly, developers could manipulate the DOM and make AJAX calls easier than ordering a cheeseburger. 🍔</p>
            
            <p>jQuery was the superhero we needed, swooping in to save us from browser inconsistencies and verbose vanilla JavaScript. It was like finding an oasis in the desert of web development – refreshing, life-saving, and almost too good to be true.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

            <pre class="code-block animated-code">
                <code class="language-javascript">
                // jQuery: Making JavaScript great again (before it was cool) 
                $(document).ready(function() { 
                  $('#myButton').click(function() { 
                    $('#content').toggle(); 
                  }); 
                });
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>jQuery didn't just make coding easier; it made it fun! 🎉 Suddenly, you could chain methods like a boss:</p>
            
            <pre class="code-block animated-code">
                <code class="language-javascript">
                $('#myElement') 
                  .addClass('awesome') 
                  .css('color', 'rebeccapurple') 
                  .fadeIn(1000) 
                  .slideUp(500) 
                  .slideDown(500);
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <div class="callout animated-callout">
                <p>jQuery was like the Swiss Army knife of web development. It sliced, it diced, it made julienne fries! But like all good things, its reign couldn't last forever. 🗡️</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>jQuery plugins became the new frontier. Need a slider? There's a plugin for that. Want a fancy lightbox? Plugin. Datepicker? You guessed it – plugin. The jQuery plugin ecosystem exploded faster than you could say "$(this)".</p>
            
            <h2 class="animated-header">🌟 The SPA Universe Expands: AngularJS and Backbone.js</h2>
            <p>As web apps got more complex, developers needed more structure. Enter AngularJS and Backbone.js, the architects of the Single Page Application (SPA) revolution. 🏗️</p>
            
            <p>These frameworks brought structure to our chaotic JavaScript world, introducing concepts like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to front-end development. Suddenly, we were building web apps that felt more like desktop applications, and our backends breathed a sigh of relief as they offloaded more work to the client-side.</p>
            
            <h3 class=>AngularJS: Google's Mad Science Experiment</h3>
            <p>AngularJS burst onto the scene in 2010, bringing two-way data binding and dependency injection to the party. It was like magic... until it wasn't. 🎩✨</p>
            
            <pre class="code-block animated-code">
                <code class="language-javascript">
                // AngularJS: Because who doesn't love a good $scope? 
                angular.module('myApp', []) 
                  .controller('MyController', function($scope) { 
                    $scope.message = 'Hello, AngularJS!'; 
                    $scope.updateMessage = function() { 
                      $scope.message = 'AngularJS is magical!'; 
                    }; 
                  });
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>AngularJS was like that one friend who's super smart but also a bit... extra. It solved problems we didn't even know we had, but also introduced concepts that made our brains hurt. 🤯</p>
            
            <h3>Backbone.js: Bringing Structure to Chaos</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, Backbone.js was like the Marie Kondo of JavaScript frameworks, helping developers tidy up their spaghetti code into neat little models, views, and routers. 🍝➡️📦</p>
            
            <pre class="code-block animated-code">

                <p>Backbone.js taught us that with great power comes great responsibility... and a lot of boilerplate code. 🦸‍♂️</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Backbone.js was minimalistic yet powerful. It gave structure without being overly opinionated, allowing developers to build large-scale applications without losing their minds. It was the JavaScript equivalent of a well-organized toolbox – everything had its place, but you still had to know how to use the tools.</p>
